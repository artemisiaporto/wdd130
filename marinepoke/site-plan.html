      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of the website is to share information about Pokémons. Many Pokémons were created based on animals and objects,
        but people do not always know about them. I want to share information about some Pokémons that were created based on fish and other sea animals.
        The site will share the information in a simple and funny way, to help people get connected.
      </p>  <!-- change this -->
      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience for this website is people who do not know about Pokémons and would like to know to interact with a group who likes it.
        The focus is on parents and older adults who do not grow up in contact with the games or animes about Pokémon and have children, teenagers,
        and young adults around them who play and have fun with Pokémon content. Knowing about Pokémon could help them to share time with their
        children/teenagers/young adults when they are playing or watching Pokémon and be able to talk about it.

      <h3>Fishes</h3>
      <p>
        Here we present three Pokémon that were inspired by fishes.
        Pokémon 1 - Stunfisk
        An electric and ground Pokémon type has as its origin the Stargazer, a fish that buries itself in the sea bottom and can make some electric discharges when disturbed.
        Pokémon 2 - Lanturn
        An electric and water Pokémon type. Its origin came from the Footballfish and the dolphins. The fish has a light ball up on its head and the dolphin is related to Apollo, the Greek sun god who has the dolphin as his signature animal.
        Pokémon 3 - Sharpedo
        It is based on shark and ocean sunfish. Both have the skin like sandpaper. Its body also remembers a torpedo, giving him a “license” to be a very fast Pokémon.

      <h3>Other Marine Animals</h3>
      <p>
        In addition to fish, there are many super interesting Pokémon that were inspired by marine animals. Here we present three of them.
        Pokémon 1 - Mantine
        A Pokémon based on manta ray. Their sizes vary from 5.5 meters to 7.5 meters, being very large. In the anime, there as scenes where the Remoraid, another Pokémon fish, swims attached to the Mantine undersides.
        Pokémon 2 - Lapras
        This Pokémon resembles the Plesiosauria, an extinct marine reptile. According to science, this animal lived on Earth, between the Triassic and Cretaceous periods.
        Pokémon 3 - Horsea
        Based on the seahorse, it also looks like a dragon. This similarity is derived from the Japanese legend which tells that when a seahorse lives for a century it becomes a dragon.
