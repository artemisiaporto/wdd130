            <p>Yes, real life inspires games more than we can imagine!</p>
            <p>This phrase is not a surprise to people who are familiar with games, but for those who are not, it could really be.</p>
            <p>Maybe you want to know more about how real life inspires games and Pokémon could help you to understand it better, they are a great example of how nature animals inspire games.
                Pokémon creators got inspiration from nature animals to create them. There is a huge quantity of Pokémon, and they could be classified by groups. The most interesting are the ones which were inspired by marine animals, so we will present them here!
                When we think of the “marine” word, we also tend to think of “fish”. There are so many sizes and names of Pokémon inspired by fishes, that could take a long time to know all of them. So, we will present some of them here!
                Being a small or big animal is not a limitation to inspire a Pokémon. There is so much more to explore about marine animals, that we can't just talk about fishes. I invite you to discover other species too!</p>
            <p>These two topics are amazing to start a conversation with people who already played Pokémon or who want to start understanding this huge Pokémon world, so don't care about your age, the content could be great for you =]</p>
            <p>Focusing on learning and sharing, this will certainly be a great opportunity for you!</p>
