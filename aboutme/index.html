    <p>Hello, everyone! It's a pleasure to meet you.</p>
    <p>I've graduated and work in Geophysics. I love to study and programming is my new focus. I want to become a Software Development to help people make their daily tasks easier.</p>
    <p>Some of my hobbies are playing League of Legends, watching anime and K-dramas, and roller skating.</p>
    <p>I hope we all can have a great semester!</p>
